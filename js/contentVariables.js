Hello! I'm Jeremy Skalla, and I'm a <span id="agecount"></span> year old Computer Science Major at the <span style="color:#7a0019">University</span> of 
<span style="color:#ffcc33">Minnesota</span>. I have experience in <span style="color:#306998">Python</span>, 
<span style="color:#5c6bc0">C</span>, <span style="color:#004283">C++</span>, 
<span style="color:#f8981d">Java</span>, <span style="color:#f7df1e">Javascript</span>, and more. 
Let's move on from coding talk, and I'll tell you about some of my other passions and my background. 
I grew up in Dallas and moved to Minnesota at age 5. I'm a huge fan of playing and watching basketball, 
especially watching the <span style="color:#00538C">Dallas Mavericks</span>. I'm also a huge soccer fan, 
and I'm a season ticket holder for <span style="color:#9BCDE4">Minnesota United</span>. I love discussing music,
and my favorite albums of all time are <span style="color:#313733">Rodeo</span> by Travis Scott, 
<span style="color:#ce1e35">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</span> by Kanye West, and 
<span style="color:#dcd1b3">What's the Story Morning Glory</span> by Oasis. My friend group and I play a decent 
amount of of poker, and I've even won a tournament at a casino before. I'm a huge trivia nerd and ended up
the all time leading scorer for my high school's Quiz Bowl team. Lastly, I'm super heavily involved in esports,
as you can see by my projects, especially Super Smash Brothers Melee.`
