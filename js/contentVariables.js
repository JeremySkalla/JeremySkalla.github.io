let aboutContent = `Hello! I'm Jeremy Skalla, and I'm a 21 year old Computer Science Major at the <span style="color:#7a0019">University</span> of 
<span style="color:#ffcc33">Minnesota</span>. I have experience in <span style="color:#306998">Python</span>, 
<span style="color:#5c6bc0">C</span>, <span style="color:#004283">C++</span>, 
<span style="color:#f89820">Java</span>, <span style="color:#F0DB4F">Javascript</span>, and more. 
Let's move on from coding talk, and I'll tell you about some of my other passions and my background.<br><br>
I grew up in Dallas and moved to Minnesota at age 5. I'm a huge fan of playing and watching basketball, 
especially watching the <span style="color:#00538C">Dallas Mavericks</span>. I'm also a huge soccer fan, 
and I'm a season ticket holder for <span style="color:#9BCDE4">Minnesota United</span>. I love discussing music,
and my favorite albums of all time are <span style="color:#313733">Rodeo</span> by Travis Scott, 
<span style="color:#ce1e35">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</span> by Kanye West, and 
<span style="color:#dcd1b3">What's the Story Morning Glory</span> by Oasis. Poker is one of my favorite past-times,
and I love trivia. Lastly, I'm super heavily involved in esports, as you can see by my projects, 
especially Super Smash Brothers Melee.`

let projectsContent1 = `<a href="https://github.com/JeremySkalla/pysmashgg" style="color:#6E5494">Pysmashgg</a> is a simple wrapper for 
<a href="https://smash.gg/" style="color:#cb333b">smash.gg's</a> 
API that takes inspiration from older wrappers, but it useds the GraphQL API instead of the older, 
slower one. It has over 16,000 downloads on PyPI and Github. I started this project in December 2020 over  
winter break. I had wanted to learn about APIs, since I hadn't learned much in school, and I was 
passionate about esports. I looked for wrappers at first, but all that existed were out of date ones 
or poorly written/documented ones. So, pysmashgg was born.<br><br>

This was written all in <span style="color:#306998">Python</span>. I organized the files in 
the github, as well as created detailed documentation about how to use the wrapper. One of my biggest goals 
with this project was to help other newer coders understand how the API works. It was pretty cool getting 
people telling me that my program helped them. I've worked on it intermittently since the start, 
as I've needed it for another one of my projects, JUMS.`
